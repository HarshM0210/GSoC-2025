# Google Summer Of Code 2025 - SU2 <br><span style="font-size:50%;">Author: Harsh Mishra</span>

**Description**:  
This project delivers an automation framework for running, verifying, and publishing **SU2** validation cases using **GitHub Actions**. It enables fully reproducible and scalable verification & validation (V&V) of CFD solvers without manual intervention.

The system comprises **two coordinated workflows**:

1. **Main Workflow** – Builds SU2, runs the selected validation cases, and generates results.
2. **Results Publishing Workflow** – Processes outputs, generates Markdown case pages, updates the V&V site data, and commits changes to the results repository.

The workflow handles everything from **fetching meshes/restart data**, **building SU2 from source**, **executing cases**, **generating plots**, to **publishing web-ready reports** — all through a single parameterized workflow dispatch.
